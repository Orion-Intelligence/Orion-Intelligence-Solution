## Login And 2FA

### Overview

Orion account access, login 2FA, email/password sign-in, authenticator code verification, demo login, verification-pending accounts, forced password reset redirects, progressive login delays, HTTP-only browser sessions, and authenticated session entry.

**Search terms:** login, sign in, open account, access Orion, 2FA login, verify 2FA, demo login.

### Navigation

`/login`.

### Quick answer

To sign in, open `/login`, enter email and password, select Sign In, then enter the 2FA code if the 2FA screen appears.

### Steps

  1. Open `/login`.
  2. Enter Email.
  3. Enter Password.
  4. Select Sign In.
  5. If 2FA appears, enter the 6-digit authenticator code.
  6. If demo access is visible, select the demo option.

### Troubleshooting

For verification-pending accounts, use Resend mail. If forced reset is active, the app redirects to the reset page. If 2FA fails, confirm the latest authenticator code and time sync. After five consecutive unsuccessful login attempts, wait for the delay shown on screen before trying again. Later consecutive failures increase the delay from 1 minute to 10 minutes and then 30 minutes. A successful login or 30 minutes without another failure resets the failure history.

## Signup And Email Verification

### Overview

Public registration, new tenant account creation, username entry, company email entry, password strength, welcome token links, resend verification mail, expired verification links, and first account activation.

**Search terms:** signup, register, create account, new tenant account, verification email, welcome token, resend verification.

### Navigation

`/signup`, `/welcome`, `/welcome/:token`.

### Quick answer

To create an account, open `/signup`, fill username, company email, and password, submit the form, then open the verification email and follow the welcome link.

### Steps

  1. Open `/signup`.
  2. Enter Username.
  3. Enter Company Mail.
  4. Enter Password and satisfy the strength meter.
  5. Select Sign Up.
  6. Open the verification email.
  7. Follow `/welcome/:token`.
  8. Return to login after verification.

### Troubleshooting

If the username already exists, use suggested alternatives. If verification mail is missing, use resend verification. If token is expired/invalid, request a new verification email.

## Password Reset, Account Recovery, And Forced Password Change

### Overview

Forgotten password recovery, global recovery keys, forced first-login password updates, reset email links, reset token pages, new password confirmation, old-password reuse validation, and return-to-login behavior.

**Search terms:** forgot password, reset password, recover account, recovery key, forced password reset, change password, reset token, update password.

### Navigation

`/reset`, `/reset/:token`.

### Quick answer

Select `Recover account?` on the login screen. Use `Reset password` to request a link by email, or use `Account recovery` with the registered email and 43-character global recovery key. Open the email link, enter and confirm a new password, then log in again.

### Steps

  1. Select `Recover account?` on `/login`, or open `/reset`.
  2. Leave `Reset password` selected and enter the registered email, or select `Account recovery` and enter both the email and global recovery key.
  3. Submit the form and open the reset email if the supplied account details are valid.
  4. Open `/reset/:token` within 20 minutes.
  5. Enter New Password.
  6. Enter Confirm Password.
  7. Submit the reset form.
  8. Return to `/login`. A forced password change returns the signed-in user to the application instead.

### Troubleshooting

Email and recovery-key format errors are shown before submission. For correctly formatted input, the same success screen appears even if the account or recovery details are wrong; this is intentional and prevents account discovery. If no email arrives, check the details and spam folder, then retry. Reset links expire after 20 minutes. The new password cannot match the old one. A newly generated recovery key replaces the old key.

## Tenant Onboarding

### Overview

First-time tenant setup, company information, initial monitored IOC seeding, onboarding completion, dashboard access gating, tenant verification, license assignment, and setup-loop troubleshooting.

**Search terms:** onboarding, first setup, tenant setup, company setup, add IOCs during setup.

  2. Enter company or tenant information.
  3. Continue to IOC setup.
  4. Choose IOC categories.
  5. Add IOC values.
  6. Review confirmation.
  7. Complete onboarding.
  8. Continue to dashboard.

### Troubleshooting

  2. Open `/dashboard`.
  3. Expand the sidebar if collapsed.
  4. Select a module group.
  5. Open the desired module.
  6. Use the profile menu for account/admin pages.

  4. Open the date picker.
  5. Select start date.
  6. Select end date.
  7. Select Apply.
  8. Use Reset to clear drawer filters.

### Troubleshooting

Older data appears when no date range is active or the range is wide. Results can look random before a query because discovery/default records are loaded. Select both dates before applying.

## Search Tools And Sorting

### Overview

Query matching modes, semantic search, any-term OR matching, individual-term AND matching, full-query AND matching, strict search, broad search, exact phrase-style search, newest-first sorting, and oldest-first sorting.

  4. Select Search/Scan.
  5. Wait for processing.
  6. Review security posture and findings.
  7. Download or print report.

### Troubleshooting

If scan fails, verify target format, reachability, license access, and network availability. Wait for completion before exporting.

  6. Start the scan.
  7. Expand DNS/IP/vulnerability rows or open the vulnerability target.
  8. Download report after completion.
  9. Cancel while scanning if needed.

### Troubleshooting

If a domain resolves to multiple IPs, inspect each row. If download is disabled, run a scan first or wait for completion. Vulnerability detail is available only after the target scan completes.

## CTI Graph

### Overview

Threat-intelligence relationship visualization, clusters, documents, properties, group nodes, edges, graph sessions, CTI filters, advanced graph builder, graph view, list view, physics toggle, node search, context menus, maximum nodes, maximum depth, export modal, current-session export, CTI report export, and relationship exploration.

**Search terms:** CTI graph, threat graph, cluster graph, document graph, property graph, advanced graph builder, graph export, graph sessions.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/ctigraph`.

### Quick answer

Open CTI Graph, set filters, apply them, inspect graph/list view, and export session or CTI report if needed.

### Steps

  1. Open CTI Graph.
  2. Create or select a session.
  3. Choose Type: cluster, document, or property.
  4. Fill cluster type, document ID, or property value where required.
  5. Set maximum nodes and depth.
  6. Select Apply.
  7. Use graph search, graph/list toggle, physics toggle, context menu, or advanced builder controls.
  8. Open the export modal and export Current Session or CTI Report.

### Troubleshooting

If graph is empty, adjust filters or use a more specific document/property. If graph is slow, reduce node/depth limits.

## Social Intel Overview

### Overview

Profile Intelligence is the Social Intelligence profile-search workspace: username scans, image-based discovery, saved profile details, live enrichment, scan history, relationship graphs, and report exports. Social Monitoring is the separate Manage Profiles page for browser sessions, personas, connected accounts, and monitored activity.

**Search terms:** Social Intelligence, Profile Intelligence, profile search, social mapper, social graph, username scan, image search, profile mapping, graph/list view.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/social-intel` or `/dashboard/social-graph`; `/dashboard/social-mapper` redirects to Social Intel.

### Quick answer

Open Social Intel, scan a username or upload an image, manage discovered profiles, add profiles/entities to graph, and inspect relationships in graph or list view.

### Steps

  1. Open Social Intel.
  2. Enter username and select Scan, or upload an image.
  3. Watch Scan History for status.
  4. Open Manage Profiles if candidates appear.
  5. Select profiles and update graph.
  6. Switch graph/list view as needed.
  7. Open profile summary or metadata popups.
  8. Export report/session when needed.

### Troubleshooting

Graph search filters loaded graph content. If image upload returns empty candidates, try a clearer profile image or username scan. If live fetching fails, review any saved Details, Online Presence, or Stealer Logs that remain visible. For **Login required**, open Login, finish signing in to the platform in the same browser, return, and select Reload. An empty profile with no saved data still needs a successful fetch. See [Profile Search](profile-search-profile-intelligence) for the full workflow.

## Social Intel Entities

### Overview

Custom graph nodes, manual entities, API-mode entities, entity lookup pivots, email nodes, domain nodes, wallet nodes, phone nodes, breach nodes, social scanner nodes, wanted-list nodes, national-identity nodes, software/app nodes, DNS nodes, Wayback nodes, IOC nodes, APK nodes, crypto nodes, entity cards, progress states, On Graph status, delete controls, and graph focus actions.

**Search terms:** Social Intel entities, custom entity, add entity, manual entity, API entity, graph node, active entities.

### Navigation

Social Intel > Entity Manager / Add Entity.

### Quick answer

Open Add Entity, choose API or Manual mode, choose entity type, enter value/query and optional label, submit, then add or focus the entity on the graph.

### Steps

  1. Open Social Intel.
  2. Open Entity Manager or Add Entity.
  3. Choose API mode or Manual mode.
  4. Select entity type.
  5. Enter value/API query.
  6. Add optional label.
  7. Submit.
  8. Click saved entity to add/focus it on graph.

### Troubleshooting

Manual entities usually have no report data. API entities can fail if input format, license, or provider/source availability is invalid.

## Social Intel Profile Summary And Stealer-Log Pivot

### Overview

Profile summary panels, loaded-platform profile details, posts, images, metadata, profile connections, Fetch Profile Leaks, profile leak intelligence, Email Breach Results, Stealer Log Results preview, copied profile values, and profile-based leak pivots.

**Search terms:** see stealerlog in Social Intel, profile leaks, Fetch Profile Leaks, profile summary, Email Breach Results, Stealer Log Results.

### Navigation

Social Intel > profile summary popup > All Platforms Summary > Fetch Profile Leaks.

### Quick answer

Scan or load a profile, open profile summary, select Fetch Profile Leaks, then review Profile Leak Intelligence for Email Breach Results and Stealer Log Results.

### Steps

  1. Open Social Intel.
  2. Scan or load a profile with username/email.
  3. Open profile summary from graph or list view.
  4. In All Platforms Summary, select Fetch Profile Leaks.
  5. Review Email Breach Results.
  6. Review Stealer Log Results.
  7. Copy values if needed.
  8. Open Stealer Logs > IOCs for full search/date filtering.

### Troubleshooting

Fetch Profile Leaks cannot run without a username/email. If no response appears, the pivot ran but no leak/stealer data matched.

## Social Intel Followers, Following, Relationships, And Context Menu

### Overview

Social followers graph, following graph, account relationship expansion, follower fetches, following fetches, posts, images, metadata, follower popups, following tabs, connection tabs, related account scans, relationship nodes, relationship details, aliases, clearing connections, delete profile actions, remove node actions, and right-click graph context menus.

**Search terms:** followers, following, social relationships, relationship popup, set alias, delete profile, clear connections, context menu.

### Navigation

Social Intel > profile summary/list row/graph node/context menu.

### Quick answer

Open a profile or relationship node, fetch followers/following/posts/images/metadata as needed, then inspect or add related accounts to graph.

### Steps

  1. Open Social Intel graph or list view.
  2. Open profile summary or follower popup.
  3. Select Followers or Following.
  4. Fetch data when needed.
  5. Filter long lists.
  6. Select accounts to scan.
  7. Add resulting accounts to graph.
  8. Right-click nodes for alias/delete/relationship actions.

### Troubleshooting

Buttons can be disabled during active fetches, after completed data loads, or on platforms with limited relationship actions.

## Social Monitoring and Browser Sessions

### Overview

Social Monitoring opens **Manage Profiles**, with **Sessions**, **Personas**, **Persona Monitoring**, **Profile Monitoring**, and **Results** tabs. It is separate from selecting discovered candidates in the profile-search popup.

**Search terms:** Social Monitoring, Manage Profiles, capture session, verify session, expired session, persona, posting, ad monitoring, hate speech, stop daily run.

### Navigation

Social Intelligence > Social Monitoring (`/dashboard/manage-profiles`).

### Steps

1. Install or update the browser extension if prompted, and sign in to the intended social platform account in the same browser.
2. In **Sessions**, use **Fetch session**, then expand the platform and verify the captured session. Use **Edit** to recapture an expired session. The limit is 10 sessions per platform.
3. For persona-based activity, add a persona, then use **Persona Monitoring > Add Account** to select its platform, session, persona, and **Posting** or **Ad Monitoring** purpose.
4. Use the selected account's **Post** or **Ad** control and follow the activity in **Results**. **Post publishes externally**; it is not a profile-data fetch.
5. For a real profile's content, use **Profile Monitoring > Add Monitoring Profile**, enter the platform and profile URL, attach a usable captured session, and start its monitoring action.
6. In **Results**, filter by Account and Show, expand findings, and inspect the status and any error reason.
7. **Stop** cancels a manual run. **Stop daily run** also stops the remaining scheduled batch; completed work is not undone.

### Troubleshooting

- Tabs unavailable: check that the extension is ready and its platforms loaded.
- No available session: capture another session for the platform or review existing assignments.
- Session Expired: sign in again, recapture/verify the session, and reconnect the profile.
- No persona assigned: assign one for Post or Ad activity. A persona can have only one assigned account per platform.
- No post content available: review the persona's age group and interests. Only one successful manual post per profile is allowed per UTC day.
- Daily scheduler running: wait before retrying a manual trigger, or use the explicitly labeled stop control if you intend to stop the daily batch.

Deleting a session disconnects the profiles using it. Deleting a persona removes its assignments. Review those confirmations before proceeding. Full instructions are in [Social Monitoring](user_manual.md#social-monitoring).

## AI Workspace And Report Chat

### Overview

Orion in-app chat, Profile AI, Nexus chat, report chat widgets, chat prompts, quick prompts, streamed responses, saved chat history, stream recovery, retry after interrupted streams, new conversations, cancel request controls, copy actions, edit-and-resend user messages, markdown responses, token limits, shared chat links, public read-only chat transcripts, AI visibility, and system-setting controlled chat access.

**Search terms:** AI workspace, Nexus chat, report chat, ask AI, chatbot, cancel chat, share response, shared chat, chat history, retry AI response.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/ai`, `/chat-share/:shareId`, report chat panel, chat widget.

### Quick answer

Open Profile > AI or the visible report chat widget, type the question, send it, and wait for the streamed response. Use Share to create a tokenized read-only transcript when sharing is enabled.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > AI or a report chat widget.
  2. Start a new chat if needed, or let saved history load.
  3. Type a prompt or choose a quick prompt.
  4. Send with Enter or the send button; use Shift+Enter for a new line.
  5. Wait for streaming response and status text.
  6. Cancel if needed.
  7. Copy responses, edit a user message, or retry from a recoverable error state.
  8. Select Share to create a tokenized read-only shared chat link.

### Troubleshooting

If AI is missing, check system setting, license, and deployment configuration. If a page reload leaves a user message without a Nexus answer, the workspace attempts recovery; retry only when the UI exposes retry context. Shared chat links show only the included transcript and do not grant dashboard access.

## Tenant Homepage, Alerts, And Notifications

### Overview

Tenant risk summaries, category alert cards, notification sidebar entries, IOC matches, alert detail drawers, alert detail reports, alert scanner settings, scan-all actions, scheduled alert scan configuration, flush actions, delete actions, mark-seen actions, custom alert modal, alert pivots, old alert date filtering, alert exports, alert prints, scanner pivots, API pivots, Stealer Log pivots, and admin tenant-alert review from case-management workflows.

**Search terms:** alerts, tenant homepage, alert summary, notification bell, notification sidebar, category alert, export alert, old alerts, alert scan, alert scanner settings.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/homepage`, `/dashboard/profile/alerts/:type`, `/dashboard/profile/alert-scanners`, notification bell.

### Quick answer

Open Profile > Homepage, select an alert category or notification, review details, then export/print, pivot to the matching module, or adjust alert scanner settings if the role allows it.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > Homepage.
  2. Review alert summaries and risk cards.
  3. Select a category card or notification.
  4. Open matching alert details.
  5. Apply Date Range if old alerts appear.
  6. Export or print the alert report.
  7. Mark seen, delete, flush, or run alert scan if allowed.
  8. Open Alert Scanner Settings to enable or disable future alert categories.

### Troubleshooting

Alerts depend on monitored IOCs, allowed scanner categories, and scan cycles. If old alerts show, apply Date Range. New IOCs can require the next scheduled or manual scan before alerts appear. Disabled alert scanner categories affect future scanning and visibility, not existing stored data.

## Take Down And Takedown Requests

### Overview

Compromise-report takedown initiation, defacement target URL review, public abuse-contact evidence capture, manual target URL submission, root-admin takedown queue, abuse email review, pending requests, accepted requests, denied requests, failed requests, rejection reasons, takedown email dispatch, duplicate target-domain prevention, and report status labels.

**Search terms:** take down, takedown, initiate takedown, report takedown, abuse email, takedown request, takedown in progress, takedown reported, reject takedown.

### Navigation

Compromise Monitoring or Defacement report > Initiate Takedown; `/dashboard/profile/take-down` or Profile > Takedown Requests.

### Quick answer

To request takedown action, open an eligible defacement report and select Initiate Takedown, or have a root administrator open Profile > Takedown Requests and use Report Takedown with a target URL. Root administrators review the saved evidence, then accept to dispatch the abuse email or reject with a reason.

### Steps

  1. Open a Compromise Monitoring or Defacement report with a target URL.
  2. Select Initiate Takedown.
  3. Wait while Orion captures abuse-contact evidence.
  4. Confirm the modal shows the captured abuse email and saved review entry.
  5. Root administrator opens `/dashboard/profile/take-down`.
  6. Search or filter by date range and status.
  7. Select Accept to dispatch the takedown email, or Reject and enter a reason.
  8. Reopen the source report to see Takedown in progress, Takedown reported, Takedown denied, or Takedown failed.

### Troubleshooting

If the button is missing, check defacement-module access, role, and whether the report has a target URL and report ID. If no public abuse contact is found, no request is saved. The review page is visible only to root-tenant administrators; non-root users can create eligible requests but cannot approve or deny them.

## Custom Alert Creation

### Overview

Manually created monitored alerts, custom alert modal, alert status, alert type, alert title, alert description, IOC type, alert source, alert URL, IOC value, content type, risk, custom indicator tracking, Add Alert form fields, saved alert records, alert update actions, and alert delete actions.

**Search terms:** custom alert, add alert, create alert, alert IOC, monitor custom IOC.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/addcustomalert` or Profile > Homepage > Add Alert.

### Quick answer

Open Add Custom Alert, fill type/status/title/description/source/URL and one IOC bucket, then save.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > Homepage.
  2. Select Add Alert.
  3. Enter Title.
  4. Enter Description.
  5. Choose Alert Type and IOC Type.
  6. Enter Source.
  7. Enter URL if needed.
  8. Enter IOC value.
  9. Save alert.

### Troubleshooting

If alert creation is unavailable, check role, active status, maintainer/tenant settings, alert scanner visibility, and required fields. URLs must use `http://` or `https://` where validation is enforced.

## Manage Tenant IOCs

### Overview

Tenant-level monitored indicators, IOC categories, IOC values, IOC chips, added indicator entries, remove indicator actions, clear category actions, saved monitored values, onboarding IOC setup, alert matching values, and tenant alert scan dependencies.

**Search terms:** add IOC, tenant IOC, monitored IOC, remove IOC, IOC categories, alert monitoring values.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/ioc`.

### Quick answer

Open Profile > IOC, select an IOC category, type a value, add it, confirm it appears, and save/update where required.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > IOC.
  2. Search/select IOC category.
  3. Type the value.
  4. Press Enter or Add.
  5. Confirm it appears under added IOCs.
  6. Remove wrong values by chip/delete control.
  7. Use Clear All only intentionally.
  8. Save/update if required.

### Troubleshooting

New IOCs can require matching data and the next scan cycle before alerts appear.

## Account Settings

### Overview

Signed-in user preferences, avatar upload, avatar delete, theme preference, 2FA, password changes, global recovery-key generation, profile visibility, user metadata, public profile access from comments, and personal account page updates.

**Search terms:** account settings, avatar, profile image, theme, 2FA, change password, recovery key, profile visibility.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/account`.

### Quick answer

Open Profile > Account to manage profile preferences and security. Orion asks for the current password before changing the password or 2FA setting, or before generating/replacing the global recovery key.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > Account.
  2. Edit visible profile preferences.
  3. Upload avatar if needed.
  4. Delete avatar if needed.
  5. Toggle theme/profile visibility where available.
  6. To change password or 2FA, perform the action and enter the current password in `Confirm your identity`.
  7. To create a recovery key, select `Generate / replace recovery key`, confirm the current password, and save the displayed 43-character key immediately.
  8. Save or let other settings auto-apply depending on control.

### Troubleshooting

If confirmation fails, re-enter the current account password. If a recovery key was replaced, discard the old value because it is no longer valid. The recovery key is displayed only once. If public profile remains hidden, check both user profile visibility and tenant profile visibility setting.

## Tenant Settings

### Overview

Current-tenant profile configuration, tenant logo, tenant image, tenant overview, assigned licenses, quota, phone, country, city, state, tenant profile visibility, tenant alert webhook connections, Event Management toggle, editable tenant fields, read-only tenant fields, and maintainer/member tenant settings.

**Search terms:** tenant settings, tenant logo, tenant data, user profile visibility, event management toggle, tenant quota, alert webhook, Slack webhook, Jira webhook.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/tenant-settings`.

### Quick answer

Open Profile > Tenant Settings, edit allowed tenant fields/toggles, upload logo if needed, and save.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > Tenant Settings.
  2. Review tenant overview, licenses, quota, and location.
  3. Toggle edit if available.
  4. Update phone/country/city/state where allowed.
  5. Upload or delete tenant logo if needed.
  6. Connect or reconnect configured Slack/Jira alert webhooks where available.
  7. Toggle profile visibility or event management where available.
  8. Save changes.

### Troubleshooting

If fields are read-only or hidden, check role, license, free-only status, and tenant permissions.

## User Management And Create New User

### Overview

Tenant user administration, user list, Add User form, username suggestions, email, password, confirm password, forced password reset flag, role, status, subscription, licenses, module access, user disable actions, user delete actions, user update actions, account mail setup, SMTP setup, license-aware sidebar access, trial subscription banner, subscription upgrade modal, and subscription request notification.

**Search terms:** create new user, add user, user creation, Add User information, manage users, disable user, assign license, require password reset, trial banner, subscription upgrade.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/users` or Profile > Users.

### Quick answer

Yes, Orion supports new user creation. Open Profile > Users, select Add User, fill the user information form, choose role/status/licenses, then select Add User.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile.
  2. Select Users.
  3. Select Add User.
  4. Enter Username.
  5. Enter Email.
  6. Enter Password.
  7. Enter Confirm Password.
  8. Choose Role.
  9. Choose Status.
  10. Select visible Licenses/module access.
  11. Set password-reset requirement if the user must change password on first login.
  12. Resolve validation errors.
  13. Select Add User.

### Troubleshooting

If Add User is disabled, configure Account Mail/SMTP fields in System Settings and confirm maintainer/tenant permissions. If username exists, use suggested alternatives. License assignment controls what sidebar groups the user can open. Limited users can see subscription prompts instead of module access, and near-expiry trial users can see a trial banner.

## Tenant Administration

### Overview

Tenant records, verification, status, quotas, and licenses. Administrators manage top-level tenants; primary maintainers manage their associated sub-tenants. Secondary tenant and sub-tenant refer to the same child organization.

**Search terms:** tenant administration, view tenants, manage tenant, tenant profile, tenant status, tenant verification, tenant licenses.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/tenant/view-tenants`, `/dashboard/tenant/view-profiles`, `/dashboard/profile/tenant`.

### Quick answer

Open Tenant > View Tenants or Profile > Tenant, select the tenant, review details, and update allowed verification/status/license/quota fields.

### Steps

  1. Open Tenant menu.
  2. Select View Tenants or View Profiles.
  3. Search/select a tenant.
  4. Review tenant metadata, users, quotas, status, and licenses.
  5. Edit allowed fields.
  6. Save changes.

### Troubleshooting

If tenant screens are missing, check admin/maintainer role and license. Admin tenant management has broader controls than current-tenant settings.

## Create Primary and Secondary Tenants

### Quick answer

Register a top-level tenant through the root domain, then have an administrator enable **Primary Tenant** in **Tenants** and assign its quotas. Register a secondary through that primary's signup page, then have the primary maintainer verify it and allocate its licenses and user quota.

**Search terms:** primary tenant, secondary tenant, sub-tenant, parent tenant, tenant signup, tenant quota, reserved users, account temporarily disabled.

### Checks

- Use the primary's URL for secondary signup; root-domain signup creates a standalone tenant.
- **Add User** creates an account, not a tenant.
- The primary's user pool counts its own non-maintainer users plus the quotas reserved for its children. Each child also has its own user limit.
- No signup link can mean the primary's tenant quota is full.
- **Account temporarily disabled** directs affected users to their network administrator. The responsible operator must check the tenant's parent, status, verification, and quota warnings.
- Disabling primary status disables its children; deleting the primary deletes its children as well.

See [Primary Tenants and Sub-Tenants](primary-tenants-and-sub-tenants) for the complete setup and quota example.

## Backup, Restore, and Tenant Exports

### Navigation

Profile/administration > **Backup & Restore** (`/dashboard/profile/backup-restore`). Tenant-row exports are under **Tenants**; administrators configure **Scheduled Backup** under **System Settings**.

**Search terms:** create backup, instant backup, scheduled backup, retention, tenant export, import ZIP, index.html, tenant.enc, recovery date, backup statistics, secondary backup.

### Quick answer

Administrators create system backups. Standalone maintainers recover their own organization, primary maintainers recover their permitted tenant family, and secondary maintainers request recovery through their primary. Tenant exports use an existing backup and do not capture new changes.

### Steps

1. For a current recovery point, ask an administrator to run **Instant Backup** and wait for completion. Scheduled backups use a three-day loop when enabled; only two system backups are retained.
2. Use **Download** for a listed backup, or **Export** on an authorized tenant row for its latest available recovery point.
3. Check the **backup taken** date, not just the date you downloaded the file. Export confirmation warns about older data.
4. Extract a copy of a tenant ZIP and open **index.html** for general statistics: backup/export dates, included tenants, users, documents, search documents, files, and counts by collection/index. A **secondary** badge identifies a child tenant.
5. To recover, choose **Restore** on a stored backup or **Import** the original tenant export ZIP. Review the date and affected tenants, confirm, and wait for the final result.

An administrator's full-system **index.html** has Overview, Account details, Connections, Findings, Organizations, and Files views, with search and empty-category filtering. It is different from the static tenant-export summary.

### Troubleshooting

- No backup contains the tenant: a system backup must complete after that tenant was created.
- A secondary cannot manage backups directly: contact its primary maintainer.
- The tenant ZIP contains **index.html** and **tenant.enc**. The HTML is a statistics summary, not the restore payload; upload the intact ZIP.
- An administrator's whole-system download is not a tenant import ZIP.
- Modified, unsupported, or incompatible encrypted payloads are rejected. Cross-installation import needs compatible encryption-key configuration managed by the operator.
- A busy job, missing disk space, or a recovery requiring manual intervention needs resolution before another attempt.

A tenant restore affects its recovery scope; a system restore places the whole site in maintenance. A restore replaces current data rather than merging later changes. See [Backup and Restore](user_manual.md#backup-and-restore) for permissions, statistics, rollback, and recovery instructions.

## Audit Logs

### Overview

Application activity history, user actions, tenant actions, searches, scans, settings changes, administrative events, actors, usernames, timestamps, audit rows, audit date filters, audit exports, and audit delete permissions.

**Search terms:** audit logs, auditlog, user activity, actor search, delete audit, export audit.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/auditlog` or `/dashboard/tenant/auditlog`.

### Quick answer

Open Audit Logs, search actor/username, apply Date Range, review rows, and export/delete if allowed.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > Auditlog or Tenant > Auditlog.
  2. Search username/actor if needed.
  3. Open Filter.
  4. Apply Date Range.
  5. Review log rows.
  6. Expand details where available.
  7. Export or delete if allowed.

### Troubleshooting

If no logs appear, clear filters or widen date range. Delete is admin-only where enabled.

## Event Management

### Overview

Tenant-scoped SIEM search, raw log search, basic event query mode, advanced event filters, Event Date range, expandable event rows, raw event details, indicator fields, tenant log investigation, and Event Management visibility.

**Search terms:** event management, SIEM logs, event search, raw logs, event date, advanced event search.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/event-management`.

### Quick answer

Open Event Management, enter a basic or advanced event query, apply Event Date if needed, run search, and expand event rows.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > Event Management.
  2. Use Basic search or open Advanced search.
  3. Enter event query/filters.
  4. Apply Event Date.
  5. Run search.
  6. Review result count.
  7. Expand rows for raw details.

### Troubleshooting

If Event Management is hidden, check maintainer license, tenant setting, role, and active user status.

## Log Manager

### Overview

Admin-only operational log review, application log entries, INFO logs, WARNING logs, ERROR logs, log date filtering, log type filtering, source files, caller fields, message text, pagination, individual log file delete, flush all logs, confirmation prompts, and operational troubleshooting.

**Search terms:** log manager, system logs, application logs, error logs, warning logs, info logs, flush logs, delete log file.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/log-manager` or Profile > Monitoring > Log Manager.

### Quick answer

Admins can open Monitoring > Log Manager, filter by type or date, review log entries, refresh, delete a log file, or flush all logs after confirmation.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > Monitoring.
  2. Select Log Manager.
  3. Filter by log type if needed.
  4. Filter by available log date if needed.
  5. Review Type, Time, File, Message, and Source columns.
  6. Refresh when checking new operational output.
  7. Delete or flush logs only when operationally intended.

### Troubleshooting

Log Manager is for admins and operational troubleshooting, not analyst investigation. If it is hidden, check admin role and account status.

## Feeder Scripts

### Overview

Feeder-enabled tenant parser configuration, feeder rule catalog, Social Media rule groups, Defacement and other rule workspaces, feeder script viewing, feeder values, Add tab, View tab, Values tab, URL value upload, parser script upload, shared session upload, ownership dialogs, owner transfer, preview, search, sorting, pagination, enable status, disable status, clear all, value management, ingestion behavior, parsing behavior, and feeder license access.

**Search terms:** feeder, feeder scripts, parser upload, feeder values, feeder workspace, defacement feeder, enable feeder, disable feeder, owner dialog.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/feeder`.

### Quick answer

Open Profile > Feeder, choose a rule, review scripts or values, add URL values or parser/session uploads, then enable, disable, clear, delete, or transfer ownership where permitted.

### Steps

  1. Open Profile > Feeder.
  2. Select the relevant rule from the catalog.
  3. Use View to inspect uploaded scripts or stored values.
  4. Use Add to upload a parser file, shared session ZIP, or newline-separated values when the rule supports it.
  5. Preview, search, sort, and paginate long script/value lists.
  6. Enable, disable, toggle, clear, delete, or transfer owner where allowed.
  7. Save or confirm the action.

### Troubleshooting

If Feeder is missing, check feeder license/module and tenant permission. Python parser uploads must use `.py`, shared session uploads must use `.zip`, and upload limits apply.

## Case Management

### Overview

Investigation case workspace, case list, filters, analytics, alerts mode, case creation, primary entity, related entities, artifacts, uploaded artifact files, artifact integrity verification, linked report artifacts, tasks, comments, linked cases, analyst assignment, tracking board, status movement reasons, closure, read-only closed cases, archive and unarchive, PDF export, tokenized public case shares, revoke shares, and admin tenant-alert review inside case workflows.

**Search terms:** case management, create case, case details, case filters, case analytics, case artifact, artifact integrity, linked report artifact, tracking board, move case, close case, archived cases, share case.

### Navigation

`/dashboard/profile/case-management`, `/dashboard/profile/case-management/tracking-board`, `/dashboard/profile/case-management/case-details?caseId=...`, `/case-share/:shareId`.

### Quick answer

Open Profile > Case Management, create or select a case, add entities/artifacts/tasks/comments, move the case through the tracking board with reasons, close it after resolution, then export, share, or archive where permitted.

### Steps

  1. Open Case Management.
